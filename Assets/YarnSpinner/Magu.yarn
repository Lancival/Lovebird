    quest6_npc: Ah... what to do, what to do... 
    Lume: ...
    quest6_npc: Oh, my! Pardon me, I did not see you there!
    quest6_npc: I am the owner of this house. How can I help you?
    quest6_npc: ...
    quest6_npc: FANTASTIC??? You flatter me, I'm so pleased! 
    quest6_npc: I do agree that this finish was beyond my expectations! The exterior is so smooth it makes my heart race.
    quest6_npc: And! I am quite fond especially of my coral, I tried to play with the fenestration of the building, what do you think? 
    quest6_npc: Instead of just windows and doors, the open space left by the jagged coral for my fishy friends... I love how natural it feels...
    quest6_npc: Ah! Sorry to jabber on so long. Actually, I'm just so happy you like it because this thing took me quite a while to complete.... 
    quest6_npc: Like "5 years" a while... 
    quest6_npc: I kept my husband waiting for so long... He's been so temperamental lately...
    quest6_npc: Ah, that's right... What to do, what to do...
    Lume: ...
    Seems like she's worrying about something.

    quest6_npc: .... Maybe from there, I hear it's popular these days? 
    quest6_npc: Oh! But oh no no, was he allergic? Was he? Oh no... how do I not know this...
    quest6_npc: !
    quest6_npc: Oh dear, oh dear, I'm sorry. My mind tends to wander. 
    quest6_npc: I remember now, you must be the new resident of VIRIDIA that everyone has been talking about! You have been getting around quite well! If I recall, Lume?
    quest6_npc: I'm MAGU. It's so nice to meet you. I'm sorry for getting off track there.
    <<set $quest6_npc to "MAGU">>
    quest6_npc: I'm so glad you like the home. 
    quest6_npc: I've just been a little worried these days because I feel I'd been neglecting my husband.
    quest6_npc: He's just so good to me, all those sleepless nights... and supporting me all through that incident with the sandstone - oh what was I thinking, 500 pounds...
    quest6_npc: ... and that...
    quest6_npc: ... and can't forget about what happened then... 
    quest6_npc: And... !!!
    quest6_npc: Anyhow, I'm in a bit of a marital pickle.
    quest6_npc: I want to do something for him. To apologize, but also to thank him...
    quest6_npc: But I was never good at these romantic gestures.
    quest6_npc: Oh, what did he see in a workaholic like me...
    quest6_npc: I'm embarrassed to ask someone whom I've just met, but... I just have too many things to prepare. 
    quest6_npc: Could you just help me out with a few tasks? I promise I will make it worth your time!!!

quest6_npc: Ah, I see, you've just moved in so of course you're busy...
quest6_npc: Please, don't worry about me and go on with your day.
quest6_npc: But if you have any time to spare later on, it will be quite a while until I finish, and I would appreciate your help...
quest6_npc: Now where should I make reservations...

quest6_npc: Really? You are willing to help?
quest6_npc: You are an absolute lifesaver, Lume! My dear loves shiny, polished things. I was thinking perhaps a pendant or a necklace?
quest6_npc: Do you think you could get one for me somewhere?

quest6_npc: Oh! Sea foam, he loves it!... Should I construct a sea foam pool?! Oh but no, that would take another four months...
Would you like to offer help?

    ->No
        You decided to continue going along your day.

quest6_npc: Hello, dear! I hope it hasn't been too much trouble finding something.
quest6_npc: These days, CHOM-CHOM's selection is just too lacking! I may have to trouble you to ask around some other folks on other islands...
quest6_npc: It could be fruitful to check THE JUNKYARD, perhaps? I heard that golem LUMPERS has become more talkative recently and he's picked up a skill, Iâ€™m so glad for that fellow.

quest6_npc: ...
quest6_npc: !!! Lume!
quest6_npc: Oh, is that the pendant I asked for?
quest6_npc: ...
quest6_npc: Ah, this is just perfect! It is just what I imagined!
quest6_npc: I can't thank you enough, Lume. Please, accept this for all your hard work.
quest6_npc: Oh my oh my, I can't wait to see his face when I get this to him!
quest6_npc: I must go at once to get everything ready now that I have this cherry on top.
quest6_npc: Lume, please visit again sometime soon. 
quest6_npc: Oh, and here are the rewards I promised you! I threw in a little something because it reminded me of you. I like to collect nature items for inspiration.
quest6_npc: Maybe my next project will be sky-themed...
You received 10 Sand Dollars!
You received a Magical Feather!

quest6_npc: I would love for you to join us at my housewarming party next week, Lume!
quest6_npc: That reminds me... you just moved in as well. Will you be having one too?
quest6_npc: Who will be going? I'm sure it'd be fun because you are there, Lume.
quest6_npc: ... Oh, not that I'm trying to invite myself to your party! Of course you must have met many friends in your travels, I would completely understand if your guest list was too full... 
quest6_npc: Ha ha...

Golem: Hi, Teacher.
Golem: ... May I call you that? 
Golem: ... You are looking for something? Materials for a necklace?
Golem: ... 
Golem: ... You can find some LOOSE THREAD on this island. The string might come in handy.
Golem: As for shiny... I've seen a few shiny rocks here and there... pretty tear shaped rocks. Like LOST AMULETS? Maybe those would work?
Golem: ... I hope I was of some help to you...
